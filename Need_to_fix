1. halt doesn't stop code. maybe put 5 halts.
2. 00000000 in the last line doesn't appear in imem0.
3. now there is a fowarding from writeback to decode, need to be fixed.
4. if branch is taken, action after fetch is incorrect - the instruction fetched is after the PC has changed. - fixed
5. after branch is taken, the instruction in the following PC has to be executed. when the following instruction is HALT - it is NOT executed.
6. when shifting more times than there are zeroes to the left, a cyclic shfit occurs. is this acceptable?
7. memin isn't loaded to the cache properly.
8. counter testbench - synchronization between cores is not working.
